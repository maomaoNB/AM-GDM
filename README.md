# AM-GDM
AM-GDM is an advanced machine learning method based on transformer to improve the performance of early GDM prediction.
# Data
Diabetes data This is a table in which data is used to predict early Gestational diabetes.

# Code
The code in the Classification folder is based on Transformer's AM-GDM model, which is used to diagnose diabetes in early pregnancy; In addition, there are classic machine learning prediction methods and deep learning methods.  <br>The code in Feature Import Analysis is used to analyze the importance of different eigenvalue items in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. This method is based on the Random forest algorithm.

# Requirements
python==3.x <br> transformers==4.10.0<br>pytorch==1.9.0<br>numpy==1.21.2
